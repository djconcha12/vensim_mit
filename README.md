# VenPy
Python Tools for Vensim

 

This package provides a pure Python wrapper to the [Vensim system dynamics simulation software](http://vensim.com) through the Vensim DLL. The Vensim DLL provides the ability to develop interfaces for pre-existing models by allowing access to some of the tools and functions used in the software itself. 

## Goals

1. Provide easy access to existing Vensim functionality in Python. This will help to facilitate:
  * Batch processing of simulation runs under a range of exogenously driven scenarios, parameter sets, or events.
  * Incorporation of changes in model structure over time.

2. Allow for the inclusion of non-existant Vensim features such as:
  * Communication and data exchange with external programs through Python subprocesses.
  * Easy integration of 3rd party Python libraries.
  * Ability to run multiple Vensim models simultaneously and exchange data between them.
 
## Documentation
A guide for basic usage of VenPy is provided [here](https://github.com/pbreach/venpy/blob/master/docs/Basic%20Usage.ipynb)

## Focus

The goals of this project are very much in line with [PySD](https://github.com/JamesPHoughton/pysd) and is in no way a replacement for this effort. In this project there is a specific focus on *Vensim* models through the DLL. This includes the use of *all* Vensim functions (depending on whether the DSS or PLE versions are installed) and features which are not available in other system dynamics simulation programs such as [Stella](http://www.iseesystems.com/softwares/Education/StellaSoftware.aspx), [Simulink](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulink), [MapleSim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MapleSim), etc.

## Limitations

Due to the dependence on Vensim's DLL functionality there comes a set of limitations with the project which must be kept in mind:

* The use of the Vensim DLL through this package can only support Windows (as far as I know)
* The version of Python must match the bitness of the Vensim version (which mainly provides 32-bit)
* Larger models will have the same performance limitations as the Vensim software
* Only constants and 'Gaming' type auxiliary variables can be set before and during simulations respectively
* Those who have Vensim PLE installed will only be able to modify model constants prior to simulation
* Potential compatibility issues with future versions of Vensim
* Likely more to come...

## Applications

Although these limitations do exist, the Vensim DLL has been used in many successful applications to extend Vensim functionality. Some of these include the works of:
